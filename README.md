# Flutter WebView macOS patches

Fixes for WebKit pages (WKWebView) embedded in Flutter macOS apps.
Each fix is a separate Flutter plugin in `packages/`; an app adds only the ones it needs.

| Package | Problem it fixes |
|---|---|
| `webview_key_guard` | A key press on a web page reaches the page more than once (macOS + Flutter redispatch of unhandled keys). |
| `webview_modal_guard` | Mouse input passes through Flutter dialogs and menus to the web page under them. |
| `webview_hover_guard` | Page hover jumps to another element or disappears when Flutter draws a frame. |

## Use in an app

```yaml
dependencies:
  webview_key_guard:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/DimitriSky/flutter_webview_macos_patches.git
      path: packages/webview_key_guard
      ref: <commit>
```

Pin `ref` to a commit; all packages of one app should use the same commit.
